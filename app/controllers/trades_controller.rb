    # Initialize filterrific with the following params:
    # * `Student` is the ActiveRecord based model class.
    # * `params[:filterrific]` are any params submitted via web request.
    #   If they are blank, filterrific will try params persisted in the session
    #   next. If those are blank, too, filterrific will use the model's default
    #   filter settings.
    # * Options:
    #     * select_options: You can store any options for `<select>` inputs in
    #       the filterrific form here. In this example, the `#options_for_...`
    #       methods return arrays that can be passed as options to `f.select`
    #       These methods are defined in the model.
    #     * persistence_id: optional, defaults to "<controller>#<action>" string
    #       to isolate session persistence of multiple filterrific instances.
    #       Override this to share session persisted filter params between
    #       multiple filterrific instances. Set to `false` to disable session
    #       persistence.
    #     * default_filter_params: optional, to override model defaults
    #     * available_filters: optional, to further restrict which filters are
    #       in this filterrific instance.
    #     * sanitize_params: optional, defaults to `true`. If true, all filterrific
    #       params will be sanitized to prevent reflected XSS attacks.
    # This method also persists the params in the session and handles resetting
    # the filterrific params.
    # In order for reset_filterrific to work, it's important that you add the
    # `or return` bit after the call to `initialize_filterrific`. Otherwise the
    # redirect will not work.
